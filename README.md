# Research-Methods-Statistics
This is a mandatory course for all MSc students in Information Systems Engineering. It is designed to cover the main steps of a typical graduate-level research cycle in information and data sciences (e.g., Ideas, Literature Survey, Proposal Preparation, Research Process, Publication, and Presentation).

Every record in the DB represents a post on the Facebook page of a company.
